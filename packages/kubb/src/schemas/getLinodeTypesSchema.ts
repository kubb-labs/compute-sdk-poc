These instances are good for low-duty workloads, where performance isn't critical.\n\n- `standard`. These instances are good for medium-duty workloads, and offer a good mix of performance, resources, and price.\n\n- `dedicated`. These instances are good for full-duty workloads where consistent performance is important.\n\n- `premium` (limited regions). This includes the features of a `dedicated` instance as well as the latest AMD EPYC&trade; CPUs. This ensures your applications are running on the latest hardware with consistently high performance. Only available in [regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) with \"Premium Plans\" in their `capabilities`.\n\n- `gpu` (limited regions). Linodes with dedicated NVIDIA Quadro&reg; RTX 6000 GPUs accelerate highly specialized applications such as machine learning, AI, and video transcoding. Only available in [regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) with `GPU Linodes` in their `capabilities`.\n\n- `accelerated` (limited regions). These leverage the power of dedicated, application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), starting with NETINT Video Processing Units (VPUs). They're ideal for video transcoding, media processing, and other compute-heavy workloads. Designed to offload specialized tasks, these instances deliver faster processing times and greater efficiency than traditional CPU-based solutions. Only available in [regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) with `Accelerated` in their `capabilities`.\n\n- `highmem`. High Memory instances favor RAM over other resources, and can be good for memory hungry use cases like caching and in-memory databases. All High Memory plans contain dedicated CPU cores.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> - A `nanode` class is listed as a 1 GB Linode in Cloud Manager.
