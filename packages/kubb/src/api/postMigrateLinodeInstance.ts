/**
 * @description Initiate a pending host migration that has been scheduled by Linode or initiate a cross data center (DC) migration.  A list of pending migrations, if any, can be accessed from [List notifications](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-notifications). When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off. If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the request body specifying the target data center region. You can view a list of all available regions and their feature capabilities from [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions). See our [Pricing Page](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) for Region-specific pricing, which applies after migration is complete. If your Linode has a DC migration already queued or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration, you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed.`vpc` details- Cross DC migrations don't work for Linodes that have a `vpc` purpose legacy configuration interface or a VPC Linode interface. They work for host migrations within the same DC.- See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications) guide for its specifications and limitations.`vlan` details:- Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.- Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools or IP Failover. If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt to migrate to an NGN data center, the migration will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.- See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.`public` details:- If the Linode is using Linode interfaces, the destination region needs to also support Linode interfaces.- After migrating to a different data center, Linode public interfaces retain the same number of IP addresses, but the IP addresses themselves change.<<LB>>---- __CLI__.    ```    linode-cli linodes migrate 123 \  --region us-central \  --placement_group.id 528    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-the-linode-cli)- __OAuth scopes__.    ```    linodes:read_write    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)
