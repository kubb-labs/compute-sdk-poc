 * @description Removes a single bucket.> 📘>> - You need to remove all objects from a bucket before you can delete it. While you can delete a bucket using the [CLI](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s3cmd/#delete-a-bucket), this operation fails if the bucket contains too many objects. The best way to empty large buckets is to configure lifecycle policies with an outside API, such as the [Ceph Object Gateway S3 API](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/bucketpolicy/#). Set a policy to remove all objects, wait a day or more for the system to remove all objects, then delete the bucket.>> - You can use an outside API, such as the [Ceph Object Gateway S3 API](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/s3/bucketops/#delete-bucket) for more options.<<LB>>---- __OAuth scopes__.    ```    object_storage:read_write    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)
