/**
 * @description This operation is equivalent to [Assign IP addresses](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-assign-ips).Assign multiple IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 ranges to multiple Linodes in one Region. This allows swapping, shuffling, or otherwise reorganizing IPs to your Linodes.The following restrictions apply:- All Linodes involved must have at least one public IPv4 address after assignment.  - For Linode interfaces, the Linode needs to have a public interface, and the address it receives can't be a private IPv4 address.- Linodes may have no more than one assigned private IPv4 address.- Linodes may have no more than one assigned IPv6 range.[Open a support ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket) to request additional IPv4 addresses or IPv6 ranges beyond standard account limits.> 📘>> Removing an IP address that has been set as a Managed Linode's `ssh.ip` causes the Managed Linode's SSH access settings to reset to their default values.To view and configure Managed Linode SSH settings, use the following operations:- [Get a Linode's managed settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-managed-linode-setting)- [Update a Linode's managed settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-managed-linode-setting)<<LB>>---- __OAuth scopes__.    ```    ips:read_writelinodes:read_write    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)
