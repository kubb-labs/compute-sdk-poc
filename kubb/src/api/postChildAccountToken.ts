/**
 * @description Create a short-lived bearer token for a parent user on a specific child account. In the context of the API, a parent user on a child account is referred to as a "proxy user." When Akamai provisions your parent-child account environment, a proxy user is automatically set in the child account. It follows a specific naming convention:    <Parent account `company` name>_<SHA256 hash of parent `company` name and child account `euuId`>> 📘>> These variables only use the first 15 and 16 characters of these values, respectively.The token lets a parent account run API operations through the proxy user, as if they are a child user in the child account.These points apply to the use of this operation:- To create a token, a parent account user needs the `child_account_access` grant. This lets them use the proxy user on the child account. You can run [List a user's grants](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-user-grants) on a parent account user to check its `child_account_access` setting. To add this access, you can [update](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-user-grants) the parent account user.- The created token inherits the permissions of the proxy user. It will never have less.- The API returns the raw token in the response. You can't get it again, so be sure to store it.Example workflow:1. [List child accounts](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-child-accounts) and store the `euuid` for the applicable one.2. Run this operation and store the `token` that's created for the proxy user.3. As a parent account user with access to the proxy user in the child account, use this `token` to authenticate API operations, as if you were a child user.<<LB>>---- __CLI__.    ```    linode-cli child-account create A1BC2DEF-34GH-567I-J890KLMN12O34P56    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-the-linode-cli)- __OAuth scopes__.    ```    child_account:read_write    ```    [Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)
