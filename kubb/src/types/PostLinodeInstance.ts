         * @description The type of interface. This can be `public`, `vlan`, or `vpc`.\n\nFor interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:\n\n- You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.\n\n- The Linode\'s default public IPv4 address is assigned to the `public` interface.\n\n- A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0` position to be reachable via the public internet, after it boots. If no `public` interface is configured, you can only access the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/), or through another Linode that\'s connected to the same VLAN or VPC.\n\nFor interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:\n\n- Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode to the VLAN with the specified `label`.\n\n- If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this address.\n\nFor interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:\n\n- Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.\n\n- When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet. See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.
